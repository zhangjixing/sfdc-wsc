# Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC) #

The Force.com Web Service Connector (WSC) is a high performing web service client stack
implemented using a streaming parser. WSC also makes it much easier to use the Force.com
API (Web Services/SOAP or Asynchronous/BULK API).


# Note #

This is the older (frozen) version of WSC. It is not going to be maintained anymore. For the latest and actively developed WSC code please visit:

Thanks!
